  %h2 A simple way to add emails to your Mailchimp list with GET and POST
  %p Mailchimp Post is a simple free service to add people to your Mailchimp list through a very simple HTTP POST or GET.  The Mailchimp API isn't that complicated but you have to submit the data in a very specific format.  This system was built because there are 3rd party systems that don't integrate with Mailchimp but that do have the ability to do simple HTTP silent posts to send information to another server.  The idea is that with this simple way to integrate with Mailchimp you can have a system you use post to this system and then this system formats your data and submits it to mailchimp.
