  %p If you want to use Mailchimp Post with Constant Contact, you'll need to jump through a few extra hoops before you can get the ball rolling.  Mailchimp Post still makes this complicated authentication process quite simple.
  %p
    Head over to
    = link_to 'https://constantcontact.mashery.com/apps/myapps', 'https://constantcontact.mashery.com/apps/myapps', :target => '_blank'
    and click on the 'Edit' link near the bottom (pictured below).
  = image_tag 'cc_auth_1.jpg', :class => 'img-responsive'
  %p
    You'll need to set the &quot;Redirect uri of oauth calls&quot; field to
    %code https://mailchimp-post.herokuapp.com/auth/cc/end
    and click on the &quot;Save&quot; button to continue onward.
  = image_tag 'cc_auth_2.jpg', :class => 'img-responsive'
  %p
    Your Constant Contact application is now ready to be linked to Mailchimp Post!  Make sure you have your API Keys ready, head to
    = succeed ', ' do
      = link_to cc_auth_url, cc_auth_url, :target => '_blank'
    and paste your generated credentials into the form.  You'll be redirected back to Constant Contact's servers again, where you'll need to sign in with your username and password.  After that, you'll just need to confirm access to your account by clicking on the button circled below.
  = image_tag 'cc_auth_3.jpg', :class => 'img-responsive'
  %p If everything went smoothly, you should be redirected back to us one last time, where you'll see all of the lists from your Constant Contact account laid out in table format.  Congratulations, your Constant Contact account is now linked to Mailchimp Post!
